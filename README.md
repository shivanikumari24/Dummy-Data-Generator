# ðŸ§ª Dummy Employee Data Generator

This project is a full-stack web app built using **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**, with a minimal frontend using plain HTML + JavaScript. It generates 10 random employee records in a MongoDB collection called `employees`, inside a database named `company`.

Every time the **"Generate Data"** button is clicked, the app:
- Clears existing data in the `employees` collection
- Generates 10 new employee documents with random values
- Includes fields like `name`, `salary`, `language`, `city`, `isManager`, and `title`
